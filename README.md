## Deploy STUNner with Helm
There are two ways to install and use STUNner. It is advised to use [STUNner with the STUNner Gateway Operator](#with-the-stunner-gateway-operator).

### With the STUNner Gateway Operator

#### Release channels

We use two different strategies to release the charts. There are stable releases and dev releases. Stable releases are numbered and considered safe to use. While the development charts are using docker images built with the latest commits. Note that the development versions are not considered stable and might contain bugs and issues.

#### Stable release

Use these commands to install the *latest stable* release of the stunner-gateway-operator and stunner helm charts.

```console
helm repo add stunner https://l7mp.io/stunner
helm repo update

helm install stunner-gateway-operator stunner/stunner-gateway-operator --create-namespace --namespace=<your-namespace>

helm install stunner stunner/stunner --create-namespace --namespace=<your-namespace>
```

#### Development version

To install the development versions of the charts follow the instructions below.

```console
helm repo add stunner https://l7mp.io/stunner
helm repo update

helm install stunner-gateway-operator stunner/stunner-gateway-operator-dev --create-namespace --namespace=<your-namespace>

helm install stunner stunner/stunner-dev --create-namespace --namespace=<your-namespace>
```


### Without the Operator in Standalone Mode 
> **Warning**  
> Standalone Mode is a legacy option that might not be supported in the future.

```console
helm repo add stunner https://l7mp.io/stunner
helm repo update

helm install stunner stunner/stunner --set stunner.standalone.enabled=true --create-namespace --namespace=<your-namespace> 
```

## Features

The Helm charts enable fine-tuning STUNner features. These features can ease management, improve performance, etc. The following part presents the available features and how to use them.

Current features:
- [Resources](#resources)
- [UDP multithreading](#udp-multithreading)
- [Graceful shutdown](#graceful-shutdown)
- [Monitoring](#monitoring)

### Resources

When running applications in a Kubernetes cluster it is essential to manage their [resource usage](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/). Carefully configuring them enables the user to have control of the number of replicas and prevent resource starvation.
The [default](/helm/stunner/values.yaml) resource request in the chart and limit is the following:
```yaml
resources:
  limits:
    cpu: 2
    memory: 512Mi
  requests:
    cpu: 500m
    memory: 128Mi
```
This means that every started `stunner` pod will request `0.5 CPU` core and `128 mebibytes` of memory. Note that pods will only start in case the cluster can successfully allocate the given amount of resources. If the cluster lacks of resources it is advised to lower the requested value. 

About the resource limits, in order to not stress the Kubernetes scheduler it is advised to keep the limits down and scale out (increase) the number of running pods if needed. Actually, it is the way, do not be afraid to scale in Kubernetes. To learn more about the scaling process take a look at our full [scaling guide](https://github.com/l7mp/stunner/blob/main/docs/SCALING.md).

### UDP multithreading

Multi-threaded UDP listeners adds the ability for STUNner to run UDP listeners over multiple parallel readloops. The
idea is to create a configurable number of UDP server sockets using `SO_REUSEPORT` and spawn a
separate goroutine to run a parallel readloop for each. The kernel will load-balance allocations
across the sockets/readloops per the IP 5-tuple, so the same allocation will always stay at the
same CPU. This allows UDP listeners to scale to multiple CPUs, thus improve the performance.

Note that this is enabled only for UDP at the moment: TCP, TLS and DTLS listeners spawn a
per-client readloop anyway. Also note that `SO_REUSEPORT` is not portable, so currently we enable
this only for UNIX architectures.

The feature is exposed via the command line flag `--udp-thread-num=<THREAD_NUMBER>` in
`stunnerd`. In the Helm chart it can be enabled or disabled with the `--set stunner.deployment.container.stunnerd.udpMultithreading.enabled=true` flag. By default it is enabled with 16 separate readloops each UDP listener.
```yaml
udpMultithreading:
  enabled: true
  readLoopsPerUDPListener: 16
```

### Graceful shutdown

STUNner has full support for graceful shutdown in Kubernetes. This means that `stunner` pods will remain alive as long as there are active allocations via the embedded TURN server, and a pod will automatically remove itself once all allocations through it are deleted or timed out. 

Note that the default TURN refresh lifetime is 10 minutes so STUNner may remain alive well after the last client goes away. This occurs when an UDP allocation is left open by a client (spontaneous UDP client-side connection closure cannot be reliably detected by the server). In such cases, after 10 mins the allocation will timeout and gets deleted, which will then let `stunnerd` to terminate. 
This feature enables the full support for graceful scale-down: the user can scale the number of `stunner` instances up and down as they wish and no harm should be made to active client connections meanwhile. 
Caveats: 
- currently the max lifetime for `stunner` to remain alive after being deleted in 1 hour: this means that `stunner` will remain active only for 1 hour after it has been deleted/scaled-down. You can always set this in by adjusting the `terminationGracePeriod` on your `stunnerd` pods.
- if there are active (or very recent) TURN allocations then the `stunner` pod may refuse to be removed after a kubectl delete. Use `kubectl delete pod --grace-period=0 --force -n stunner stunner-XXX` to force removal.

The default termination period is set to 3600 seconds (1 hour). To modify it use the `--set stunner.deployment.container.terminationGracePeriodSeconds=<NEW_PERIOD_IN_SECONDS>` flag.

### Monitoring

The monitoring guide assumes an up-and-running `Stunner-Gateway-Operator` in the user's Kubernetes cluster.

#### Configuration

Metrics collection is *not* enabled in the default installation. In order to open the
metrics-collection endpoint for a [gateway hierarchy](https://github.com/l7mp/stunner/blob/main/docs/GATEWAY.md), configure an
appropriate HTTP URL in the `metricsEndpoint` field of corresponding the
[GatewayConfig](https://github.com/l7mp/stunner/blob/main/docs/GATEWAY.md#gatewayconfig) resource.

For instance, the below GatewayConfig will expose the metrics-collection server on the URL
`http://:8080/metrics` in all the STUNner media gateway instances of the current gateway hierarchy.

```yaml
apiVersion: stunner.l7mp.io/v1alpha1
kind: GatewayConfig
metadata:
  name: stunner-gatewayconfig
  namespace: stunner
spec:
  userName: "my-user"
  password: "my-password"
  metricsEndpoint: "http://:8080/metrics"
```

#### Installation

A full-fledged Prometheus+Grafana helm chart is available in the repo [here](/helm/stunner-prometheus/). To use this chart, install the Prometheus+Grafana stack with helm.

1. **[Expose the STUNner metrics-collection server in the GatewayConfig](#configuration)**


2. **Install the Prometheus+Grafana stack with a helm chart**

This helm chart creates a ready-to-use Prometheus+Grafana stack in the `monitoring` namespace: installs Prometheus along with the prometheus-operator, and Grafana; configures PodMonitor for monitoring STUNner pods, and sets up Prometheus as a datasource for Grafana.

```console
helm repo add stunner https://l7mp.io/stunner
helm repo update

helm install prometheus stunner/stunner-prometheus
```

Learn more about how to enable, configure and use monitoring [here](https://github.com/l7mp/stunner/blob/main/doc/MONITORING.md#installation).

#### Disable monitoring

By default STUNner is deployed with the monitoring port exposed in the STUNner pods.

If you wish to avoid the port exposition, you can install STUNner with monitoring disabled:

```console
helm install stunner stunner/stunner --create-namespace --namespace=stunner --set stunner.deployment.monitoring.enabled=false
```
